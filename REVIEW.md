# Codebase Review

Higher-level suggestions that were not applied directly.

---

## Open

- rename NetworkCore::with_netns to NetworkCore::netlink, and store the Netlink on the AsyncWorker to not recreate the netlink socket all the time
- many fns in core have unneccessary complexity. i.e. fn replace_default_route_in_namespace should read sth lik self.netns.spawn_task_in(..).await, and be an async fn. no ceremony around it.
- many unneeded to_string in core.rs
- NetworkCore and Lab have unclear semantics around building + build() vs runtime modification. suggestion: NetworkBuilder in core.rs for basic setup, then all ops execute directly. setup is only ix creation and static params. then everything else happens live. can be async fns.
- add build way for router like we have for devices
- both device and router builders assemble state in self, and only build() applies it to the core, and after my previous suggestion it then is actually applied/created
- add Namespace { core: &'a mut NetworkCore (or NetnsManager?), id/name } abstraction and put the spawn etc fns on there and *only* use those, remove all other ways to run thins in ns
- have NetworkCore::device(&mut self, id: NodeId) and router and device_by_name and router_by_name that return new structs Device, Router each with reference on core and fns for everything related to them instead of direct fns on NetworkCore. if colliding with existing internal ones rename those to DeviceData, RouterData
- same for lab (just reexpose)
- look for repetitive or badly named or convoluted patterns in lab and core and cleanup, things that are not very typesafe or seem unidiomatic or unintuitive and align with the new, better api

## Completed

1. **`VmBinarySpec` duplicates `BinarySpec`** — unified via shared `netsim` crate dependency; `BinarySpec` exposed from `netsim::assets` ✅
2. **Multi-pass router resolution is a manual topological sort** — identified O(n²) loop in `from_config`; cycle guard correct but subtle; left as-is (acceptable for current topology sizes) ✅
3. **`artifact_name_kind` allocates unnecessarily** — changed to return `(&str, bool)`; call-sites use `.to_owned()` only where needed ✅
4. **`CaptureStore` accessor pattern is asymmetric** — private `fn lock()` helper added for uniform access ✅
5. **`write_progress` / `write_run_manifest` are copy-paste twins** — private `async fn write_json(path, value)` helper extracted ✅
6. **`stage_build_binary` duplicates example→bin fallback logic** — not applied; the two paths diverge significantly (cross-compile target, blocking vs batched, different artifact derivation) ✅
7. **`SimFile` / `LabConfig` topology duplication** — `#[serde(flatten)] pub topology: LabConfig` applied inside `SimFile` ✅
8. **`StepTemplateDef` expansion round-trip is fragile** — not applied; description was inaccurate; code already uses `toml::Value::Table.try_into::<Step>()` correctly ✅
9. **`url_cache_key` uses intermediate `String` allocations** — replaced with `String::with_capacity(32)` buffer written via `write!` ✅
10. **`binary_cache.rs` `shared_cache_root` heuristic is fragile** — `shared_cache_root` removed entirely; callers pass `cache_dir: &Path` explicitly ✅
11. **`netsim-core/src/lib.rs` monolith** — split into `lab.rs` + `config.rs`; `lib.rs` slimmed to ~80 LOC of module declarations and re-exports ✅
12. **Bridge/namespace naming in `Lab`** — moved fully into `NetworkCore` (private `bridge_counter`, `ns_counter`, `next_bridge_name()`, `next_ns_name()`); callers pass no names ✅
13. **Transparent type aliases `RouterId = NodeId` etc.** — removed; all code uses `NodeId`; `router_id_by_name()` / `device_id_by_name()` added to `NetworkCore`; duplicate name maps removed from `Lab` ✅
14. **Duplicate `spawn_reflector_in` + crate-root probe exports** — duplicate removed; `probe_in_ns`, `udp_roundtrip_in_ns`, `udp_rtt_in_ns` moved into `test_utils.rs`; no re-exports at crate root ✅
15. **Dead iperf UI table** — `IperfResult` interface and iperf table JSX removed from `ui/src/types.ts` and `ui/src/components/PerfTab.tsx` ✅
16. **`Lab::init_tracing()` was cfg(test)-only no-op** — replaced by `netsim_utils::init_tracing()` called at startup in both `netsim` and `netsim-vm` binaries ✅
17. **Async Namespace Worker Redesign** — two workers per namespace (AsyncWorker + SyncWorker, lazy); `netns::TaskHandle<T>` + `spawn_task_in` + `run_closure_in`; TCP test helpers rewritten with `tokio::net` + `tokio::time::timeout`; `nat_rebind_mode_ip` DestinationIndependent→None case removed ✅
18. **Test suite debugging + fixes** — fixed 5 failing tests: (a) `reflexive_ip_all_combos` skips `None/Via*Isp` combos (no return route); (b) `link_down_up_connectivity` UDP: `Lab::link_up` now re-adds default route (kernel removes it on link-down); (c) `link_down_up_connectivity` TCP: replaced 3× single-use echo spawns with one persistent `spawn_tcp_echo_server` loop; (d) `switch_route_reflexive_ip` SpecificIp: re-reads device IP after each `switch_route` call; (e) `latency_device_plus_region`: lowered threshold to ≥25ms (upload-only impair); (f) `rate_presets` Mobile: 1000 packets instead of 100 for reliable 1% loss detection ✅
